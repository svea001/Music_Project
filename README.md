# Spotify-MoodBased-Playlist-Generator
This webpage allows users to input their name and a desired playlist name on the homepage, followed by 5 brief questions on the next page, 
in order to generate a playlist tailored to the user's mood and personal preference. The program will then add this playlist to the user's Spotify account.
The program can select under 100 songs from a database of over 2000 (and counting).
